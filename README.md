The documentation for the Hangman Game.

assets folder : 
    audio: including audios that added into the game, 
    fonts: font used in the game,

All the javascript files that are included in the game are in the scripts folder, except for the firebase configuration file which is added to the gitignore since I have uploaded it to the github. 

HTML files are not in a specific folder but in the HANGMAN folder.

How to open the game:
* First Visual Studio Code IDE needs to be there which is the easiest way to execute the project. 
* Then Open the project folder through VS Code and to execute the game, click 'Go Live' option in the right bottom corner. 
* Or else right click in a HTML file and click 'Open with Live Server' then the game will run in a browser.
